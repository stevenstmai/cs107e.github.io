    + A fun read on [how the Raspberry Pi came to be](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/inside-the-raspberry-pi-the-story-of-the-35-computer-that-changed-the-world/) for a taste of the adventure to come.

CS107e has limited enrollment due to constraints on lab space. We choose the course cohort before the start of the quarter to aid students with their planning.

Come to our information session Mon Dec 20th 2pm ([zoom link](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/96306373862?pwd=cVYrdHI4TmhNamtoY1NCQ0FuYWlDQT09) to join live) to learn more about the course and whether it is right for you. Attend in person and bring your questions! If you missed it, here is the recording on [canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/146439/external_tools/3367) and the direct link to the [Panopto video](
    https://stanford-pilot.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9a9a8cfd-b9c6-4f72-8b4e-ae0401859d8a).

The [student questionnaire](https://forms.gle/KAbzfTqP9HV6QL5e9) will open after the info session and it will close on December 28th. Prospective students must fill out the questionnaire to be considered. We will notify you about enrollment decisions by end of year.
