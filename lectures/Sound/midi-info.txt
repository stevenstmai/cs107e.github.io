For midi:

1. files in staff/lectures/C-mastery/code/midi
2. Makefile:
  make on its own will make midi-beat (drums on the drum kit)
  make install will make and install midi-beat
  
  make install midi-lamb will make and install midi-lamb
  
3. MIDI-in pins:
  white wire to 220ohm resistor to 5V on Pi
  red wire to 220ohm resistor to pin BCM/GPIO 25

4. For PulseView logic analyzer with DreamSourceLab DSLogic Pro:
  a. Ground goes to Pi ground
  b. Signal pin goes to red MIDI (pin 25 on Pi)
  c. Set voltage range on PulseView to 1.6V for 0/1
  d. Set UART as decoder, with 31250 baud rate (8n1)
  e. In UART, choose "Stack Decoder" and select MIDI
  
5. Actual pinout of MIDI connector:
