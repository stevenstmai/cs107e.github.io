    Readings:
    + A fun read on [how the Raspberry Pi came to be](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/inside-the-raspberry-pi-the-story-of-the-35-computer-that-changed-the-world/) for a taste of the adventure to come.
    + For background, review our guides on [electricity](/guides/electricity/), [binary/hexadecimal numbers](/guides/numbers/), and the [unix command line](/guides/unix). 
    + Bookmark this collection of [unix video tutorials](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1186/unixref/) that were prepared for CS107 students. These videos cover basic concepts, common utilities, development tools, and productivity features.
    + I also recommend Steven Wolfram's blog post [Untangling the Tale of Ada Lovelace](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace) for a nice description of Charles Babbage's and Lady Ada Lovelace's roles in developing the concept of a general-purpose computer.
